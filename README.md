# Colorize Black&White Images Python

Colorize black & white images, using machine learning in Python.

## Model

- `colorization_release_v2.caffemodel`: It is a pre-trained model stored in the Caffe frameworkâ€™s format that can be used to predict new unseen data.
- `colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt`: It consists of different parameters that define the network and it also helps in deploying the Caffe model.
- `pts_in_hull.npy`: It is a NumPy file that stores the cluster center points in NumPy format. It consists of 313 cluster kernels, i.e (0-312).
